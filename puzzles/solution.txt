The problem is that sizeof() operator returns an unsigned number.

*** 1.02
"-" not allowed in variable names.

*** 1.03
Output is "1". Reason is that "continue" skips the rest of the loop and 
start from the loop condition.

From MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6e3dc2z3(v=vs.80).aspx

Any remaining statements in the current iteration are not executed. 
The next iteration of the loop is determined as follows:

- In a do or while loop, the next iteration starts by reevaluating the 
  controlling expression of the do or while statement.

- In a for loop (using the syntax for(init-expr; cond-expr; loop-expr)),
  continue causes loop-expr to be executed. Then cond-expr is reevaluated 
  and, depending on the result, the loop either terminates or another 
  iteration occurs.

stdout is a (line) buffered stream, and only guarantees to flush when
- a newline is put in
- stream is closed
- program exits
- buffer is full
- fflush() called

*** 1.05
h(f(1,2)) will be expanded to h(12) first, then g(12), then 12
g(f(1,2)) will be expanded to #(f(1,2)) = f(1,2) 

In the second case # preprocessor make the expansion before the argument
expansion.

" A parameter in the replacement list, unless preceded by a # or ## 
preprocessing token or followed by a ## preprocessing token, is replaced
by the corresponding argument after all macros contained therein have 
been expanded. "

*** 1.06
Tricky question. Note "defau1t" spells wrong. Becomes a tag for GOTO.

*** 1.07
0x5 = 0b0101, first loop right shifts every bit 1 at even location by 1
second loop right shifts 2 every 1 at "location divisible by 4"
etc
therefore if a bit is 1 at location x originally, it will be right shifted
by x.

*** 1.08
floating point arithmetic may not be exact at all.
float/double uses IEEE 754
float: 23 bits of significand, 8bits exponent, 1 sign bit
double: 52 bits of significand, 11 bits exponent, 1 sign bit
in float 0.1f = 0.00011001100(1100..)
so exponent is -4, and significand is (1)10011001100110011001100
result value?
